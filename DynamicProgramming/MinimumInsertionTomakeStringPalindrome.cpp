/*
Given a string s. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make s palindrome.

A Palindrome String is one that reads the same backward as well as forward.

Example 1:

Input: s = "zzazz"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string "zzazz" is already palindrome we don't need any insertions.

*/
